## Projects

### Spam SMS Detection

Fraudulent SMS messages often attempt to deceive users into revealing sensitive information or engaging in malicious activities. Traditional rule-based methods may not effectively capture the dynamic nature of fraudulent content.<br>
In this project, the goal is to develop a model for detecting fraudulent SMS messages using the TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) technique and the Naive Bayes algorithm.  Fraudulent SMS messages can pose significant security risks and negatively impact users' experiences. By leveraging natural language processing and machine learning, this project aims to identify and filter out fraudulent messages, enhancing the overall security of communication systems.
